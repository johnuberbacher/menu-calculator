# menu-calculator
Imagine you have started up a small restaurant and are trying to make it easier to take and calculate orders, well this script should do it. 

## Goal
To quickly take orders, this scrpt allows the user to type in a string of numbers and it calculate sthe cost of the order. 
For example, if one large drink, two small drinks, two hamburgers, one hotdog, and a salad are ordered, the user should type in 5993348, 
and the program should say that it costs $19.50.
